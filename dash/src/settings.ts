//
// The update check lives here rather than in About for the same reason: the
// version of the APP is not a property of the document. A workbook written in
// 2026 opens in every later build, so "am I running the newest app" is a
// question about this copy of the reader's software.

 * that has never been saved is the STARTER this build just made — the demo at
 * bento.page/dash, a template someone is kicking the tyres on — and it has no
 * user, no history and nothing to update. PLATFORM §5 makes dormancy the rule
 * for collaboration in as many words ("a fresh template or demo must never
 * phone home"), and an update check is the same promise: opening the app must
 * not be an event anybody's server sees. Once the file exists on disk it is
 * somebody's document, and telling its owner that a newer app exists is the
 * whole point of the signed channel.
 *
 * The other two are the viewer's own settings — the launch check is opt-OUT
 * (`bento-auto-check`), Offline mode is an absolute no.
 *
 * Pure, and exported, because every one of these failures is silent: a check
 * that never fires looks exactly like a channel with nothing new on it.

// --- theme: a VIEWER preference, never the document's --------------------------
//
// The same shape as story.ts's reduced-motion switch and the interface
// language: ONE PERSON's preference about their own screen, in localStorage,
// never in the format (PLATFORM §8). `doc.theme` in model.ts is a DIFFERENT
// thing — the document's own palette, which travels in the file and colours
// the charts and the static preview. Nothing here touches it.
//
// THE MECHANISM IS kernel/src/theme.ts, shared with slides, spaces and type:
// `data-theme` on <html>, which styles.css keys off, plus `color-scheme` for
// the browser's own furniture. Dash had its own store here until 2026-09-12 —
// a transient <style> pinning `color-scheme`, with the palette written as
// light-dark() pairs — and the reason it gave was a real, measured bug: with
// the attribute set at module load, `bento.serialize()` came back with
// `<html data-theme="light">`, because capturePristine() clones the live
// document and every save re-serializes that clone.
//
// THE ANSWER TO THAT IS ORDER, NOT A DIFFERENT MECHANISM. startTheme() is
// called from main.ts AFTER capturePristine() and before the first paint, so
// the pristine copy never carries the attribute and nothing is painted in the
// wrong theme first. slides documents the same two constraints at its own call
// site. The rig proves the saved-file half by serializing under a dark theme
// and grepping the result.
//
// What decided the switch: measured in a browser, `data-theme="dark"` on dash
// did nothing, so a shared kernel stylesheet keyed off the attribute — the only
// key slides can use, since it pins `color-scheme: only light` — could not have
// themed dash at all. The same localStorage key ('bento-theme') was already in
// use here, so an existing preference carries over untouched.
