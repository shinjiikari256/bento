// bento/dash theme rig — the palette contract, checked as text.
//
//   node scripts/test-dash-theme.ts        (Node ≥ 23.6 strips types natively)
//
// WHAT THIS PROVES. A stylesheet has no type system and no runtime errors. Every
// failure this rig covers renders a page that LOOKS fine, which is why each of
// them shipped:
//
//   1. AN UNDECLARED TOKEN IS A DEAD RULE, SILENTLY. `color: var(--accent-ink)`
//      with no --accent-ink declared is not an error — the declaration is
//      invalid at computed-value time, the property falls back to `inherit`,
//      and the rule simply does nothing. dash shipped exactly this: two rules
//      in styles.css referenced --accent-ink, nothing ever declared it, and the
//      two marks they draw (a total that covers only part of a filtered sheet;
//      the "＋ add a total" invitation) had never once appeared. pivot.css's
//      `var(--ui, …)` was the same shape with a fallback, so the pivot rendered
//      off a stand-in font stack rather than the app's.
//   2. TWO APPS DRIFTING APART ONE GREY AT A TIME. bento/slides is the shipped
//      app and its palette is the suite's. dash had re-picked five of slides'
//      colours to neighbouring values — #f8fafc for #f5f7fa, #f1f5f9 for
//      #eceff4, #64748b for #5b6472 — none of them a decision anybody made, all
//      of them visible when the two apps sit side by side. So the LIGHT values
//      of the shared names are compared against slides' :root, in slides'
//      file, every run. A deliberate divergence is allowed, but it has to be
//      written down in DIVERGENCES below, with the reason.
//   3. A CONTRAST FLOOR THAT NOBODY RE-CHECKS. --muted carries 11–11.5px
//      captions and was 4.34:1 on --hover and 4.22:1 on --accent-wash — under
//      AA, on two of the grounds a caption most often lands on. Contrast is
//      arithmetic; it should not need a person with a colour picker.
//   4. A FOCUS RING THE KEYBOARD USER CANNOT SEE. The brand amber is 2.02:1 on
//      white, and WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.11 asks 3:1 of a focus indicator. dash was
//      focusing with --accent in four places and with --sel-ring in two others,
//      i.e. it had two answers and one of them failed.
//   5. `light-dark()` IS A <color> FUNCTION AND NOTHING ELSE. Fed a number it
//      does not fail loudly — the declaration is invalid, the property takes
//      its initial value, and the effect is whatever that happens to be.
//      --bar-opacity hit this and spent a release fully opaque at 1.49:1. Any
//      non-colour token that varies by theme has to do it in a media query.
